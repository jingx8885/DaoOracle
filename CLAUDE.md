## Content Architecture

### 📋 Writing Guidelines (.mdc files)
The repository uses `.mdc` (markdown configuration) files as writing guidelines for each major topic:
- These files provide structured frameworks, content requirements, and quality standards
- Example: `twoworld.mdc` provides comprehensive writing guidance for philosophical articles
- Each major analysis directory contains an `.mdc` file defining the analytical framework

### 🔍 Data Collection & Analysis
- **Python Scripts**: Data scraping and financial analysis (e.g., `bilibili_spider.py`)
- **Structured Research**: Each topic follows a systematic approach from data collection to analysis to conclusions
- **Multilingual Content**: Primarily Chinese with some English financial data and analysis

### 📝 Documentation Standards
- **Detailed Analysis**: Each topic contains multiple supporting documents, drafts, and reference materials
- **Historical Context**: Many analyses include extensive historical background and timeline analysis
- **Cross-referencing**: Frequent references between related topics and analysis frameworks

### Content Development Workflow
1. **Research Phase**: Gather primary sources, data, and background information
2. **Framework Application**: Use relevant `.mdc` guidelines for structure and quality standards  
3. **Draft Creation**: Develop initial analysis following established templates
4. **Refinement**: Iterate based on framework requirements and analytical depth
5. **Cross-referencing**: Link related analyses and maintain consistency across topics

- Content editing and analysis
- Data processing (where Python scripts are present)
- Document organization and cross-referencing
- Translation and localization (Chinese ⟷ English)

### Quality Standards
- **Analytical Depth**: Each analysis should provide historical context, current assessment, and future implications
