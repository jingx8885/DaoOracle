## Repository Overview

This is a research and documentation repository focused on Chinese infrastructure projects, particularly the Three Gorges Dam project and related companies like China Yangtze Power (长江电力). The repository contains academic and financial analysis documents rather than software code.

## Repository Structure

- `package.json` - Empty Node.js project configuration (minimal setup)
- `长江电力.md` - Comprehensive Chinese-language documentation about:
  - Three Gorges Dam construction history (1994-2012)
  - China Yangtze Power company development and stock performance
  - Financial analysis of related companies during construction period
  - Investment opportunities and beneficiary companies

## Content Focus

The main content covers:
1. **Historical Analysis**: Three Gorges Dam construction phases from planning (1920s) to full operation (2012)
2. **Financial Performance**: Stock analysis of China Yangtze Power (600900.SH) showing initial volatility followed by sustained growth
3. **Beneficiary Companies**: Analysis of construction contractors, equipment manufacturers, and material suppliers who benefited from the project
4. **Economic Impact**: Investment amounts, power generation capacity, and financial returns

## Working with This Repository

Since this is primarily a documentation repository:
- Content is in Chinese focusing on infrastructure and financial analysis
- No active software development or testing workflows
- Primary task would be content editing, translation, or analysis
- No build processes, linting, or testing commands needed

## Note

This repository appears to be for research/academic purposes focusing on Chinese infrastructure projects and related financial markets rather than software development.
